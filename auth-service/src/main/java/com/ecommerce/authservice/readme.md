Clarity First: Why both auth-service and user-service are needed?
✅ auth-service – What it does
Responsibility	Details
🔐 Security Logic	Handles registration & login
🔑 JWT Generation	Issues tokens for authenticated users
✅ Token Validation	Via JwtFilter & SecurityConfig
📦 Stores User	Stores credentials (User entity) — used for authentication only

🧠 It does not manage user profile, details, address, orders, etc. – it only verifies credentials and issues JWT.

✅ user-service – What it will do
Responsibility	Details
👤 Manage User Data	Handle full user profile like name, email, contact info, roles, etc.
🧾 CRUD APIs	Add/update/delete/get user details
🛡 Secured by JWT	Access only with token issued by auth-service
🗂 Real business data	Could include orders, carts, addresses (later)

🔁 NO need to duplicate Spring Security, JwtFilter, etc. in user-service. It will just validate token sent by client using JWT filter, not generate it again.

🔄 So do layers repeat?
Layer	In auth-service	In user-service	Notes
controller	Yes	Yes	Handles requests in both
dto	Yes	Yes (but different DTOs)	AuthRequest vs. UserDTO
entity	Yes	Yes	User.java in auth has only creds; here full user profile
repository	Yes	Yes	For managing business-level user data
service	Yes	Yes	No token logic here, only user business logic
security	✅ Full (JwtFilter, Config)	🔁 Only JwtFilter config for token validation
jwt util	Yes	Maybe reused (can keep in common-lib later)	Optional

Client
|
|---> POST /auth/register → auth-service → stores login user
|---> POST /auth/login    → auth-service → returns JWT
|
|---> GET /users/me       → user-service (with JWT in header)
|
|-- JwtFilter → validate token
|-- Controller → fetch user details
📌 So What You’ll Do in user-service:
Must-Have:
UserController.java – endpoints for profile access

User.java – entity with full profile details

UserRepository.java – JPA for DB

UserService.java – to manage user data

JwtFilter.java – just to validate token, not generate

SecurityConfig.java – configure token-based access (reused filter)

✅ Conclusion:
NO duplication of login/register/JWT generation

You’ll reuse the JWT issued by auth-service to protect endpoints in user-service

user-service focuses on business-level user data, not authentication

Let’s start creating the basic structure of user-service now?
